## HackerRank

My personal path into HackerRank using Swift and ObjC.

### SimpleArraySum
Given an array of integers, find the sum of its elements.
[Swift](Swift/SimpleArraySum.swift) 
[ObjC](ObjC/SimpleArraySum.m)

### PlusMinus
Given an array of integers, calculate the ratios of its elements that are positive, negative, and zero.
[Swift](Swift/PlusMinus.swift) 
[ObjC](ObjC/PlusMinus.m)

### DiagonalDifference
Given a square matrix, calculate the absolute difference between the sums of its diagonals.
[Swift](Swift/DiagonalDifference.swift) 
[ObjC](ObjC/DiagonalDifference.m)

### CompareTriplets
Compare 2 triplets and return the result in points.
    If a[i] > b[i], then a is awarded 1 point.
    If a[i] < b[i], then b is awarded 1 point.
    If a[i] = b[i], then neither receives a point.
[Swift](Swift/CompareTriplets.swift) 

### Staircase
Write a program that prints a staircase of size n.
[Swift](Swift/Staircase.swift) 
[ObjC](ObjC/DiagonalDifference.m)

### MinMaxSum
Given five positive integers, find the minimum and maximum values that can be calculated by summing exactly four of the five integers.
[Swift](Swift/MinMaxSum.swift)

### BirthdayCakeCandles
Given an array with all candle's sizes, return how many candles are tallest.
[Swift](Swift/BirthdayCakeCandles.swift)

### ApplesAndOranges
Given the value of d for m apples and n oranges, determine how many apples and oranges will fall on Sam's house (i.e., in the inclusive range [s,t]).
[Swift](Swift/ApplesAndOranges.swift)

### QueenMovement
You will be given a square chess board with one queen on it. Determine how many squares the queen can move.
[Swift](Swift/QueenMovement.swift)

### HighlightedText
Using the letter heights given (h array has the height of all 26 letters), determine the area of the rectangle highlight in mmÂ² assuming all letters are 1mm wide.
[Swift](Swift/HighlightedText.swift)
