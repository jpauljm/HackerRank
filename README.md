## HackerRank

My personal path into HackerRank using Swift and ObjC.

### SimpleArraySum
Given an array of integers, find the sum of its elements.
[Swift](Swift/SimpleArraySum.swift) 
[ObjC](ObjC/SimpleArraySum.m)

### PlusMinus
Given an array of integers, calculate the ratios of its elements that are positive, negative, and zero.
[Swift](Swift/PlusMinus.swift) 
[ObjC](ObjC/PlusMinus.m)

### DiagonalDifference
Given a square matrix, calculate the absolute difference between the sums of its diagonals.
[Swift](Swift/DiagonalDifference.swift) 
[ObjC](ObjC/DiagonalDifference.m)

### CompareTriplets
Compare 2 triplets and return the result in points.
    If a[i] > b[i], then a is awarded 1 point.
    If a[i] < b[i], then b is awarded 1 point.
    If a[i] = b[i], then neither receives a point.
[Swift](Swift/CompareTriplets.swift) 

### Staircase
Write a program that prints a staircase of size n.
Eg.: Staircase of size n=4
